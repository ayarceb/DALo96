# Data-Assimilation-interactive-tool
This interactive tool lets explore the Lorenz 96 dynamics in a range of configuration that the user can modify. The main purpose is to be a tool for easily explain general concepts of the Data Assimilation techniques using the Lorenz 96 model

The forcing parameter can be adjusted in the slider and it can be disturbed with a multiplicative factor with a input knob.

The Lorenz 96 model is
